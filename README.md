# generate_wordlist
This script is written in Bash, and is used to generate a wordlist based on user-defined settings, such as the length of the words and the type of characters used. It also allows the user to encrypt the word list using multiple encryption methods (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, Base64, Base32).
